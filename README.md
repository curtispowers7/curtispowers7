Hello, 

I'm Curtis Powers and I currently work as a Vulnerability Management Consultant for TransUnion. 

In my job, I am required to use scripts to accomplish different functions. The PowerShell scripts are indicative of the type of work I've done in the past. 
The Python scripts are exercises that I have done to try and transfer some of my skills from PowerShell into Python. 

Thanks!
